pam-rs
========

Rust interface to the pluggable authentication module framework (PAM).

The goal of this library is to provide a type-safe API that can be used to
interact with PAM.  The library is incomplete - currently it supports a subset
of functions for use in a pam authentication module.  A pam module is a shared
library that is invoked to authenticate a user, or to perform other functions.

## üåê [pam-http](pam-http)

An example of using pam-rs by performing HTTP basic access auth to authenticate users.

## üçª [pam-sober](pam-sober)

If you aren't sober enough for basic math, you can't login!
