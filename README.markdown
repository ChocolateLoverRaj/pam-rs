rust-pam
========

Rust interface to the pluggable authentication module framework (PAM).

The goal of this library is to provide a type-safe API that can be used to
interact with PAM.  The library is incomplete - currently it supports a subset
of functions for use in a pam authentication module.  A pam module is a shared
library that is invoked to authenticate a user, or to perform other functions.

For more information, see the package documentation.  To build the
documentation:

    $ cargo doc

Then open

	target/doc/pam/index.html
